"""
This module defines various engine steps for evaluation, validation, visualization, testing, inference, and feature extraction.

The `EvaluationStep` class serves as a base class for implementing specific evaluation-related steps. Subclasses such as `ValidationStep`, `VisualizationStep`, `TestStep`, `InferenceStep`, and `FeatureExtractorStep` provide concrete implementations for different stages of the training and evaluation process.

Classes:
    EvaluationStep: Base class for evaluation-related engine steps.
    ValidationStep: Engine step for validation.
    VisualizationStep: Engine step for visualization.
    TestStep: Engine step for testing.
    InferenceStep: Engine step for inference.
    FeatureExtractorStep: Engine step for feature extraction.
