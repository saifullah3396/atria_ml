"""
This module registers external learning rate scheduler modules to the LR_SCHEDULER registry.

The `ext_modules` module is responsible for adding PyTorch and Ignite learning rate schedulers
into the `LR_SCHEDULER` registry. This allows these schedulers to be easily accessed and used
throughout the training pipeline.

Imports:
    - LR_SCHEDULER: A registry for learning rate schedulers from the `atria_ml.registry` module.

Functionality:
    - Registers PyTorch learning rate schedulers such as StepLR, MultiStepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR.
    - Registers the Ignite ReduceLROnPlateauScheduler for advanced learning rate scheduling.
